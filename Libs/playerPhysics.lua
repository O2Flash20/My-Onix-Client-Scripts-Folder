---Comes with the vectors library :).

---A table of last positions. Meant for internal use by the library.
PlayerPhysics.pPoints = {}
---A table of last velocities. Meant for internal use by the library.
PlayerPhysics.vPoints = {}
-- Time that the library has been running.
PlayerPhysics.time = 0
---How much velocity data should be smoothed. A lower number will make PlayerPhysics.velocity react faster to real motion but output will be more noisy.
PlayerPhysics.velocitySmoothing = 10
---How much acceleration data should be smoothed. A lower number will make PlayerPhysics.acceleration react faster to real motion but output will be more noisy.

-- it may be an issue that the smoothing values are global for all scripts huh

---The player's position in the form of a vectors library vec.
